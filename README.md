## Loan Repayment Management System

This repository contains the code and documentation for a loan repayment management system, focusing on segmenting borrowers based on risk level, tenure completion, and ticket size. It also provides spend recommendations for communication channels to improve repayment rates while minimizing costs.

### Overview

The project aims to optimize loan repayment management by leveraging data analysis and segmentation techniques. By understanding borrower behavior and characteristics, lenders can tailor communication strategies to improve repayment rates and minimize costs.

### Key Features

1. **Data Segmentation**: Analyze borrower data to segment borrowers based on risk level, tenure completion, and ticket size.
2. **Communication Channels**: Recommend communication channels (Whatsapp Bot, Voice Bot, Human Calling) based on borrower characteristics and cost-effectiveness.
3. **Cost Optimization**: Provide insights to optimize resource allocation and maximize repayment rates while minimizing costs.

### Data Sources

The project utilizes borrower data containing the following attributes:

- Amount Pending
- State
- Tenure
- Interest Rate
- City
- Bounce String
- Disbursed Amount
- Loan Number

### Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to derive necessary features and segment borrowers.
2. **Segmentation**: Analyze borrower characteristics to segment them into different risk categories, tenure completion stages, and ticket size cohorts.
3. **Communication Strategy**: Develop recommendations for communication channels based on cost-effectiveness and borrower characteristics.
4. **Implementation**: Implement the recommended communication channels and monitor their effectiveness in improving repayment rates.

### Project Structure

1. **Data Analysis**: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and segmentation.
2. **Communication Channels**: Documentation and scripts for implementing communication channels (Whatsapp Bot, Voice Bot, Human Calling).
3. **Reports**: Summary reports, visualizations, and recommendations.
4. **README.md**: Main project documentation providing an overview, instructions, and information on how to replicate the project.

### Conclusion

Effective loan repayment management requires a deep understanding of borrower behavior and tailored communication strategies. By segmenting borrowers based on risk profile, tenure completion, and ticket size, and implementing targeted communication channels, lenders can improve repayment rates while minimizing costs. This repository provides the necessary tools and recommendations to achieve these objectives and enhance the efficiency of loan repayment management.
